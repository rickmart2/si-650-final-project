# si-650-final-project
- Data: Due to Githubs file size constraints, I was unable to upload all of my data files to my repository, so I instead added all of my project files to this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PeTfvx2SDR5mrlvE1VemDMOC83p296OB?usp=sharing
- Running the system:
  To interact with the system, run all cells in l2r_implementation.ipynb, then call l2r_search(). This function accepts two parameters: query and topk. Topk defines how many recipes are returned. Query is a string in the following format: "(cooking difficulty) (health level) (ingredient list)". The cooking difficulty must be either "easy" or "difficult", the health level must be either nothing or "healthy", the ingredient list is simply a list of ingredients. Include no puntuation anywhere in the query. The following is an example query: "easy healthy flour sugar baking powder chocolate chips butter".
